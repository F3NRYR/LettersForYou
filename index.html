    <h2>Another Day</h2>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>Dear Hanna,
    <br><br>
    Today I woke up and started another day
    <br>
A pretty normal one; had lunch, played with kiwi, applied to some jobs and got frustrated by the lack of apparent opportunities.
<br>
Normally that’s when I’d feel overwhelmed and I’d open CS to play a couple of matches to block those negative feelings out. But I chose to open the Google Certificate thingy instead and did that for a while. Not for too long, but long enough. A step forward, nonetheless.
<br><br>
The day, however, was marked by a conversation we had about a month ago. 
<br>
From the moment I woke up I couldn’t get it out of my head, and it would come back every few hours to haunt me until I put pen to paper and confront it.
<br>
You see, at the time you had gone out with your friends, and we were disconnected for a couple of hours. You finally got back to me hours later and were a bit drunk. 
<br>
That was probably the 3rd outing you have had in a short span, and I was feeling left out, angry, scared, worried.
<br>
Not because of you meeting your friends - you were just having fun, and you deserved it!
<br>
But because I was scared that you would somehow forget me and move on. I was worried that you would meet someone new. I was angry because I was hating myself and I was powerless.. Or at least that’s how I felt at the time.
<br>
I was frustrated because you’d flipped my photo on the back of your phone and that somehow meant you were ashamed of me and you didn’t want people to see me.
<br><br>
I know now there’s plenty I could’ve done differently in that situation. 
<br>
I could’ve given you more attention and showed you that you were always on my mind, showed you I was worth keeping around. 
<br>
I could’ve found stuff to do together over the phone and kept us connected. I could’ve told you how I was feeling, and more importantly I could’ve planned our future together to make sure we had something to look forward to. 
<br><br>
But instead, I detached myself slightly. In search for validation, in search for that ‘what’s wrong baby’ message that would show me you still loved me. 
<br>
You had always been spot on in the past in detecting when I was feeling hurt, and you asking had always felt like a hug to my soul, a bit of validation and reassurance that I’m still your mono. Even when I wasn’t making things easy for you.
<br><br>
Of course, in doing that, in my search for reassurance, I was hurting you in the process. 
<br>
So, you asked me why I was being distant.. why was I not saying ‘I love you, I miss you’ more often. 
<br>
You said you weren’t doing anything wrong so why was I making you feel like you had.
<br>
And even back then, this feeling of me failing you took over me. Why was I doing that? I mean I know why.. for the reasons I listed above! But you didn’t deserve to feel that way. You deserved to be treated like the amazing woman you are. So, I would walk my attitude back and reassure you that I loved you, and that nothing was wrong. Hiding the truth that I was in fact really hurt, and moving on to the next topic, to the next day..
<br>
I can learn many things from this life lesson.
<br>
 But the most important one is communication.
<br>
A flourishing relationship must have it as a foundation. 
<br>
So, from my side of things, I should’ve communicated my feelings and I should’ve shown you how much I fucking loved you. Even if I was scared, even if I was hurting, even if it rained.
<br><br>
Forever yours,
<br><br>
Franz

    <h2>Always And Forever</h2>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>
      Dear Hanna,
      <br><br>
      
I’m not sure how to navigate the waters that are ahead of us.
<br>
I’ve accepted the fact that the only thing that can heal us now is time.
<br>
I need to let you breathe, I need to let you figure out your feelings. I need to be careful enough not to make you sigh and say: ‘not this again, not this guy… ‘
<br>
But time.. Time is also the thing that can make us move on and grow apart.
<br>
So, you see.. I am at an impasse right now
<br>
On one hand, the reality of the pain I caused you and the dreadful consequences that came with it.
<br>
On the other, the unstoppable feeling that burst out of my heart screaming DON’T YOU DARE GIVE UP NOW!
<br>
Ultimately, I must let things play out and run the risk of losing you for good.
<br>
But I will not go down without a fight. And another fight, and another fight… Because you deserve nothing less than that.
<br>
And as long as I live and breathe, I will still be your mono, your love, your heart.
<br>
With that in mind, I built this website. 
<br>
It’s a love letter to you, and I’ll share anything here; from grandiose badly written poems to small stuff like how my day was. 


      
      <br><br>
      Forever yours,
      <br><br>
        Franz
