    <p>
      Dear Hanna,
      <br><br>
      
I’m not sure how to navigate the waters that are ahead of us.
<br>
I’ve accepted the fact that the only thing that can heal us now is time.
<br>
I need to let you breathe, I need to let you figure out your feelings. I need to be careful enough not to make you sigh and say: ‘not this again, not this guy… ‘
<br>
But time.. Time is also the thing that can make us move on and grow apart.
<br>
So, you see.. I am at an impasse right now
<br>
On one hand, the reality of the pain I caused you and the dreadful consequences that came with it.
<br>
On the other, the unstoppable feeling that burst out of my heart screaming DON’T YOU DARE GIVE UP NOW!
<br>
Ultimately, I must let things play out and run the risk of losing you for good.
<br>
But I will not go down without a fight. And another fight, and another fight… Because you deserve nothing less than that.
<br>
And as long as I live and breathe, I will still be your mono, your love, your heart.
<br>
With that in mind, I built this website. 
<br>
It’s a love letter to you, and I’ll share anything here; from grandiose badly written poems to small stuff like how my day was. 


      
      <br><br>
      Forever yours,
      <br><br>
        Franz
